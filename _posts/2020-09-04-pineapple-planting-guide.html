        tocheck whether it's ready: it must produce a sweet, potent smell showing thatyou've picked it at the perfect
        opportunity to begin another pineapple plant.
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Make sure the pineapple isn't underripe. It should be ready to
                createanother pineapple.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Check to ensure the pineapple isn't extremely ready by pulling alittle
                at the leaves. On the off chance that they come directly off, thepineapple is too ready to even consider
                planting. Be gentle. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Make sure the pineapple doesn't have scale pests around the base ofthe
                leaves. They seem as though little dirty dark spots.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Twist the leaves off the head of the pineapple. Handle the body of thepineapple with one hand and utilize the
        other to get the leaves at the baseand contort them off. This technique guarantees that the base of the
        leaveswill remain perfect. It will be attached to a base measure of natural product,which you don't require all

                remains flawless. New roots will grow from this, and without it, theplant won't develop.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Strip off a portion of the lower leaves to uncover the stem. This enablesthe stem to grow roots once it is
        planted. Strip until a couple of creeps of thestem are uncovered. Remove any outstanding organic product
        withoutharming the stem. </li>
    <li>Turn it upside down and let it dry for seven days. The scars where youmade a cut and eliminated the leaves will

        inside, however little enough so you cancrutch it up to shield it from getting lower. </li>
    <li>Stick a couple of toothpicks into the pineapple crown. Spot them oppositeone another close to the head of the
        stem. Push them insufficiently far withthe goal that they'll remain set up. These toothpicks are utilized to
        suspendthe pineapple crown in the glass of water. </li>
    <li>Put the crown in the water. The toothpicks should lay on the edge of theglass. The stem ought to be lowered in
        the water, and the forgets aboutshould stick the top. </li>
    <li>Place the glass in a bright window and trust that the roots will grow. Itshould take a few days or up to half a
        month for white roots to jab out andstart to develop.
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Keep the plant away from extraordinary temperatures. Try not tolet it
                get excessively hot or excessively cold.</li>

        they've gotten long enough toornament in soil. On the off chance that you plant the crown too soon, itwon't
        progress admirably. As you plant it, ensure that the base of anyoutstanding leaves is simply above soil level.

        the leaves, trailed by blue blossomsand in the long run an organic product. It takes around a half year for
        thenatural product to completely create. The pineapple will develop from thebloom, over the ground, in the focal
        point of the plant.</li>
