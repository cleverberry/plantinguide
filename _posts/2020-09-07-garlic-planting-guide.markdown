<h4>Garlic Planting Guide</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Plant from September 15 to November 30. The ideal time is October after the principal light ice. </li>
<li>Garlic is a weighty feeder and preferences a speck of dirt with a pH of about 6.5, free and rich with loads of natural issue to give great seepage.</li>
<li>Plant the biggest cloves to develop the biggest bulbs. Leave the external skin on the bulbs and don't separate the cloves from the bulb until you are prepared to plant. </li>
<li>Plant the cloves root end down, pointed end up, 6-8" separated. Spread with 2" of soil and a 6" layer of mulch (grass clippings blended in with leaves, straw, grass and roughage, or horse feed). Try not to eliminate mulch in the spring; it helps control weeds, defense wetness, and gives supplements as it decays.</li>
<li>Cloves will start to grow through the covering in 4 two months, depending on the variety and the climate conditions. The plants may endure ice or a little freeze and will endure the climate. </li>
<li>Garlic will start to rise in late winter. A foliar application of fertilizer or two is valued up to May 15. Try not to treat after May 15 as this is hindering. </li>
<li>Garlic needs around 1" of water every week during the developing season. Stop all watering about June 1; this permits the bulbs to frame better and collect more without any problem. </li>
<li>Scapes" are the wavy stems that regularly structure as the garlic develops. Cutor sever them after they are 10" long – they will repress bulb development whenever permitted to develop, and they are acceptable in soups and pan-sears. •Harvest after leaf pass on the back starts and there are as yet five green leaves staying on the plant – at some point in June or early July relying on the year and your atmosphere. Try not to stand by extremely long or the bulbs will start to isolate the ground. Keep weeds leveled out ahead of schedule. Garlic doesn't contend well with weeds</li>
<li>Dig the garlic cautiously, don't pull the tailor it will isolate from the bulb. Be mindful so as not to hit the garlic against a hard item or one another. It will wound. Eliminate from the sun right away. </li>
<li>Tie in a heap of 6-10 and hang in a covered, dry, very much ventilated shelter or carport. Leave hanging for 4 a month and a half.</li>
<li>After altogether drying, trim off the roots and cut the stalks off around 1/2 crawl over the bulb. Store in net packs – old onion sacks are acceptable. For ideal stockpiling, hang in a region with 45-55 percent mugginess and a temperature of50-70 degrees. Try not to refrigerate.</li>
<li>At all stages handle your garlic cautiously. It is alive! Wound it and it won't keep. </li>
<li>Hold back your most delightful bulbs for replanting.</li>
