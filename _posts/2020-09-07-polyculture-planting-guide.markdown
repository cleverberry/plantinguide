        different seeds however dissolve themindependently. Spread with a light sprinkling of fertilizer.</li>
    <li>Start cabbage transfers. Plant the cabbage seed in gardening soil at aseed level. Transfer them to 6-packs or
        little pots when they have 2genuine leaves.</li>
    <li>Pull the radishes when they are sufficiently huge to eat, beginning arounda month from planting. Succeed them
        with cabbage plants, dispersed 1foot, or all the more separated.</li>
    <li>Pull the serving of mixed greens beginning around a month and a half inthe wake of planting. Pull just what you
        require for a plate of mixed greensevery day. Replace them with plant bean seeds separated in any event 18inches
        separated. Sprinkle basil seeds on the dirt between the beanseeds. </li>

        transfers.</li>
    <li>Gather the cabbages varying after they structure heads. Pull the root,smooth the dirt and sprinkle a couple of
        carrot seeds on the territorywhere the cabbage developed. Spread them with around one-quarter inchof fertilizer.
