<h4>Propagation Information</h4>

<p>Echeveria ‘Azulita’ offsets freely, and we mean freely, to form many small clusters. That means seemingly prolific cultivar countless with lovely powder blue leaves. This rosette can blush gorgeous pink to red tips when grown in bright light. Great for windowsill gardening or dish gardens. Forms arching flower spikes of bright golden-orange flowers that hummingbirds can't get enough of. It also produces lots of offsets that can be removed and transplanted or left to develop into a tidy colony. Echeveria ‘Azulita’ is an Altman Plants original hybrid. Its flowers attract hummingbirds and butterflies.</p>

<h4>Care Information 
</h4>

<p><strong>Location in Planting</strong> - Echeveria 'Azulita' just isn't cold hardy, just in case you reside in a zone which will get cooler than twenty (20)° F. It is better to grow this succulent inside a container which may be brought inside the house. It does very well in total to partial sun. When growing inside, set in a place which will get a large amount of sunlight, like near a facing window.  During the hard frost, they will not survive but if there is a risk of freezing temperatures they can be brought inside the house to grow. 
</p>

<p><strong>Watering</strong> - Like most succulents, the 'Azulita' needs great drainage and infrequent water to prevent rot. It’s best to use the “soak and dry” method, and allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings. Pick containers with water drainage holes to drain the excess water.
</p>

<p><strong>Leaves</strong> - To propagate' Azulita' coming from leaves, you have to twist or rotate a leaf from the mother plant. Make sure that not one of the leaves continues to be on the stem, or maybe you are going to have a lesser chance of success. Let the leaf to become dry out for a handful of days so that the conclusion callouses over, and next place on well-draining soil. Water whenever the dirt is totally dried out.
</p>

<p><strong>Offset</strong> -The 'Azulita' will make little rosette offsets. You have to cut the offsets off as a result of the key stem with a strong, sterile knife or scissors will do. This allows the offsets to dry out for one (1) to two (2) days before laying on well-draining soil. 
</p>

<p><strong>Soil</strong> - Rapidly-draining, gritty soil is vital for Echeveria, as they're used to growing in minor crevices to come down with rocky outcroppings. They won't put up with standing water, so pick sandy dirt like cactus/succulent potting blend. Soil amendments aren't essential, but gardeners can encourage faster growth by using slow-release, low nitrogen fertilizer in spring.
</p>

<p><strong>Hardiness</strong> - Cold hardy down to twenty (20)F - thirty (30)F. They can stand with a light frost, but shouldn't be maintained at consistently below freezing temperatures. Gardeners in all of the regions, nonetheless, can enjoy Echeveria year-round as indoor plants - simply be certain they are given a lot of direct sunlight.
</p>

<p><strong>Echeveria</strong> is actually among the most gorgeous and well known of all the succulents and involves minimal maintenance to cultivate. If issues do arise, they are frequently connected to an absence of light or maybe an excess of drinking water. When growing inside, keep Echeveria near sun-drenched windows or perhaps under devoted grow lights.
</p>

<p>For water-related issues, focus on the soil and the plant for symptoms of over or perhaps underwatering. Place a finger or perhaps popsicle stick into the earth to determine it's completely dry out before watering and stay away from letting droplets try to sit on the leaves if at all possible. A dry succulent is much simpler to revive than one which has started to rot, and so err on the edge of much less frequent watering.
