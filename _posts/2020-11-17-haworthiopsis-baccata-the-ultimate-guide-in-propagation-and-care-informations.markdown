<h4>Propagation Information
</h4>

<p>Haworthiopsis Baccata is also referred to as Haworthia coarctata and earlier recognized as Hawhorthia baccata. The loving shade succulent is growing the propagated offsets which develop in clumping mounds. The green shiny leaves are covered by beautiful pearl-like little tubercles developing a white-coloured bumpy pattern and 4-6 cm long, triangular-lanceolate, tips incurved. The leafy stemmed Haworthia is popular, being relatively simple to grow. The tiny deep green succulent has a small rosette which grows upward. The leaves are triangle-shaped with white bumps or light green on the exterior of the leaves. The proliferous species of basic cultivation and comparatively low maintenance, developing clumps in nature. It's also a beneficial houseplant and certainly will be a great issue for the outset succulent pile (they could develop quite easily on windowpane sills, verandas what about miniature succulent gardens just where they're glad to share the habitat of theirs with various other smaller succulent plants, or perhaps in outside rockeries). It's a winter grower and is actually dormant in probably the hottest summer months.
