<h4>Care Information

It does very well in total to partial sun. Plant in a location of the garden of yours that will get six (6) hours of the sun one day. In a case growing inside the house, set in a place which will get a large amount of sunlight.
</p>

<p><strong>Watering</strong> - Sedum can live for weeks of drought but will decay or rot very easily if it is overwatered. We highly suggest making use of a container with a water drainage hole. Water thoroughly then hang on to completely dry out before watering again. It is better to make use of the soak and dry technique, let the soil dry out totally between waterings. Watering frequency may vary based on container, dirt,  and local weather
</p>

<p><strong>Leaves</strong> -  Blue Jelly Beans propagate very well from leaves. When going for a leaf for propagation, carefully rotate the leaf in the stem. Make certain that the leaf you receive is actually a clean pull, in which no component of the leaf is actually still left on the stem. This can provide you with a much better chance of good propagation. It's not unusual for Sedum pachyphyllum to drop leaves. You are able to gather the dropped foliage and propagate them too.
